Experiment 7 - Using Ansible
1. Update Your System
Open your terminal and run:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
​
2. Install Ansible
Install Ansible using apt:
sudo apt install ansible -y
​
Verify the installation by checking the version:
ansible --version
​
Expected Output Example:

3. Creating an Ansible Inventory
An inventory file lists the hosts you want to manage. For this experiment, you can use the local host.
Create an Inventory File
Open your text editor to create a file called hosts.ini:
gedit hosts.ini
​
Add the following content to define the local host:
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
​
Explanation:
[local] is a group name.
localhost is the target host.
ansible_connection=local tells Ansible to execute commands on the local machine without SSH.
3. Save and exit the file.
4. Writing a Basic Ansible Playbook
You will now create a simple playbook that performs two common tasks:
Updating the apt cache
Installing a package (e.g., curl)
5. Create the Playbook File
Open your text editor to create a file called setup.yml:
gedit setup.yml
​
Add the following YAML content:
---
- name: Basic Server Setup
  hosts: local
  become: yes # Use privilege escalation (sudo)
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt cache
      apt:
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Install curl
      apt:
        name: curl
        state: present
​
Explanation:
name: Provides a descriptive name for the play.
hosts: Specifies the group or hosts from the inventory file.
become: yes: Uses sudo to perform tasks that require elevated privileges.
Tasks Section:
Update apt cache: Uses the apt module to update the package cache.
Install curl: Uses the apt module to install the curl package if it isn't already installed.
Save and exit the file.
6. Running the Ansible Playbook
1. Execute the Playbook
In your terminal, run the following command:
sudo ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini setup.yml
​
Explanation:
ansible-playbook: The command to run an Ansible playbook.
i hosts.ini: Specifies the inventory file.
setup.yml: The playbook file you just created.
Expected Output:
An output that details each task. For example, a task summary might show "ok=2 changed=1" (if the apt cache was updated and curl was installed).
